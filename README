This is an experiment. 

xa65 is a 6502 cross assembler, running on Unix (and Unix-alikes), and producing 6502 and 65816 code. It comes complete with a set of tools.

xa65 was originally authored by me, Andr√© Fachat, but currently and still xa65 is maintained by Cameron Kaiser at http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/ . 

Due to current time constraints Cameron can not do any updates, so I decided to create this repository to publish my (beta) version that implements a long outstanding feature: assembler listings...


These are the directories:

xa		- contains the main source. The master branch is the stable version


These are the current branches:

master		- stable branch, currently 2.3.5
listing		- experimental branch that adds ca65 compatibility features and assembler listing
